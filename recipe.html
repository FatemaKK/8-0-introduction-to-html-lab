            Kulfi is a very popular South Asian frozen dairy dessert generally made with milk and sugar. It can be served as a cone-shaped dessert, and it can also be made into popsicles. You may call it Indian-style ice cream which is creamier and a little denser than regular ice cream. Kulfi comes in many flavors. The traditional flavors of kulfi are cream (malai) kulfi, rose (gulab) kulfi, gulkand pista kulfi, pistachio (pista) kulfi, mango (aam) kulfi, cardamom (elaichi) kulfi, and saffron (kesar) kulfi.
            Thandai is a very famous and delectable Indian style cooling milk drink made using milk, sugar, dry fruits (almonds, pistachios, cashews), seeds (melon seeds, poppy seeds, fennel seeds), aromatic spices (black peppercorns, cinnamon), and flavorings (cardamom, rose, and saffron), etc.
            Thandai is believed to have originated during the mythological era. It was the favorite drink of Lord Shiva. 
            Thandai kulfi is a creamy, rich, and nutty thandai flavored kulfi where Thandai Powder (premix) is combined with milk, cream, sugar, and some flavorings.

                Directions

              <hr class="solid">
              <ol>
                  <li>Dry roast almonds, cashes and pistachios for 6-7 minutes in low flame. Once cooled grind together with poppy seeds, cardamoms, fennel seeds, peppercorns and melon seeds. This powder can be stored for some time OR grind all the ingredients to a fine paste with 1/4 cup milk.</li>
                  <li>Take milk in a wide sauce pan. Bring it to a boil. Simmer for 10 minutes. Add sugar, thandai masala powder and mix well. Now simmer till 3 cups of milk is reduced to 1 1/2 cups. This may take around 30 minutes. While simmering be sure to scrape the sides and collect the malai and add it back to the simmering milk.</li>
                  <li>Once the milk is reduced, add khoya and mix thoroughly. Add silvered almonds and pistachios. Cool to room temperature.</li>
                  <li>Pour the milk in kulfi moulds and freeze for 8 hours or overnight. Once frozen, show the kulfi moulds under running water. Kulfi will slide off easily, insert sticks and serve thandai kulfi immediately.</li>
